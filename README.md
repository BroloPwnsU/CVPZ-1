PZ 'cause it sounds easy.

##What?
As consultants we are constantly needing to keep up our resumes updated with every engagement and the details of accomplishments. This isn't a terrible task as many of us have a git repository that holds and versions our resume well. Working in many contracts with local government poses a number of different time consuming tasks manually querying resume information to fill out matrix and other forms. The thought came to build a simple tool that can host this information in a format that allows us to automate this. Another benefit to this could be for consulting companies. For the small consulting shop it could be used to rapidly search consultants skills even availability for up coming contracts. 

##Why?
We have hoping to inspsire community involvement by building a simple and useful tool. We want to inspire anyone who wants to be involved to come and play. As a community we can expose eachother to our favorite technologies and libraries. We can build relationship and refine our soft skills. Hopefully affecting our local development community in a positive way.
